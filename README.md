Manifests for the CCKP can be generated using [Docker] or Python (3.7+).
Regardless of approach, a Synapse account is required, as well as an Entrez
account (strongly recommended).  Failing to provide Entrez credentials will
most likely result in timeout errors from NCBI.

## Generate with Docker

### Setup

1. Create a file called `.env` and update its contents with your Synapse
[Personal Access Token] (PAT) and [NCBI account info].

```
# Synapse Credentials
SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN="PAT"

# Entrez Credentials
ENTREZ_EMAIL=email
ENTREZ_API_KEY=apikey
```

2. Open a terminal and log into the Synapse Docker hub.

```
docker login docker.synapse.org
```

### Usage

Run the Docker container, replacing `/path/to/.env` with your path to `.env`.

```bash
docker run --rm -ti \
  --env-file /path/to/.env \
  --volume $PWD/output:/tmp/output:rw \
  docker.synapse.org/syn7080714/pubmed_crawler:v2.1.0
```

If this is your first time running the command, Docker will first pull the image
(max. 1-2 minutes) before running the container.

Depending on how many new publications have been added to PubMed since the last
scrape (and NCBIâ€™s current requests traffic), this step could take anywhere from
10 seconds to 15ish minutes.  Once complete, a manifest will be found in a folder
called `output`, with a name like `publications_manifest_yyyy-mm-dd.xlsx`, as
well as manifest templates for datasets, files, and tools.

## Generate with Python

### Setup

1. Download `pubmed-crawler` where you want on your local machine, e.g. `$HOME`,
`Desktop`, etc.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mc2-center/pubmed-crawler.git
```

2. In the `pubmed-crawler` directory, copy `.envTemplate` as `.env`, then update
its contents with your Synapse [Personal Access Token] (PAT) and [NCBI account info].

3. Install the dependencies for the Python scripts, ideally in a virtual
environment, e.g. [conda] or [pyenv].

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set environment variables from `.env` so that the scripts will have access
to the credentials.

```
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

### Usage

Run the command:

```
python pubmed_crawler.py -t syn21868591
```

This will pull all grant numbers from **Portal - Grants Merged** (syn21918972),
use them as the search terms in PubMed, then compare the PMIDs found in PubMed
with the existing ones in **Portal - Publications Merged** (syn21868591). The
final output will be a new manifest named `publications_manifest_yyyy-mm-dd.xlsx`
in the `output` folder.

If there are accompanying datasets, data files, and/or tools, be sure to generate
their templates as well:

```
python generate_templates.py
```

## Next Steps
Fill out the manifest(s) as needed, using the pre-defined Controlled Vocabulary
listed in **standard_terms** for applicable columns.  Once complete, validate
upload the manifest(s) with the MC2 Data Curator App (coming soon!).
