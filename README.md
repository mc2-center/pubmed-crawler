Manifests for the CCKP can be generated using Docker or Python (3.7+).
Regardless of approach, a Synapse account is required, as well as an Entrez
account (strongly recommended).  Failing to provide Entrez credentials will
most likely result in timeout errors from NCBI.

## :whale: Generate with Docker

### Setup

1. Create a file called `.env` and update its contents with your Synapse
[Personal Access Token] (PAT) and [NCBI account info].

```
# Synapse Credentials
SYNAPSE_AUTH_TOKEN=PAT

# Entrez Credentials
ENTREZ_EMAIL=email
ENTREZ_API_KEY=apikey
```

2. Open a terminal and log into the Synapse Docker registry. Provide your
Synapse credentials when prompted.  You should only need to log in once, 
assuming you do not switch registries.

```
docker login docker.synapse.org
```

You can also log in non-interactively through `STDIN` - this will prevent
your password from being saved in the shell's history and log files:

```
cat ~/syn_password.txt | docker login docker.synapse.org --username <syn_username> --password-stdin
```

### Usage

Run the Docker container, replacing `/path/to/.env` with your path to `.env`.

```bash
docker run --rm -ti \
  --env-file /path/to/.env \
  --volume $PWD/output:/tmp/output:rw \
  docker.synapse.org/syn21498902/pubmed_crawler
```

If this is your first time running the command, Docker will first pull the image
(max. 1-2 minutes) before running the container.

Depending on how many new publications have been added to PubMed since the last
scrape (and NCBIâ€™s current requests traffic), this step could take anywhere from
30 seconds to 15ish minutes.  Once complete, a manifest will be found in a folder
called `output`, with a name like `publications_manifest_<yyyy-mm-dd>.xlsx`, as
well as manifest templates for datasets, files, and tools (where `<yyyy-mm-dd>`
is the current date).

## :snake: Generate with Python

### Setup

1. Clone this repo where you want on your local machine, e.g. current directory,
`Desktop`, etc.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mc2-center/pubmed-crawler.git
```

2. In the `pubmed-crawler` directory, copy `.envTemplate` as `.env`, then update
its contents with your Synapse [Personal Access Token] (PAT) and [NCBI account info].

3. Install the dependencies for the Python scripts, ideally in a virtual
environment, e.g. [conda] or [pyenv].  For example:
  
```
conda create -n pubmed-crawler python=3.9
conda activate pubmed-crawler
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
  
4. Set environment variables from `.env` so that the scripts will have access
to the credentials.

```
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs)
```

### Usage

While in the virtual environment, run the command:

```
python pubmed_crawler.py -t syn21868591
```

where:

* [`syn21868591`] is the Synapse table containing publications already curated for the CCKP

PubMed Crawler uses this table to compare against publications found in PubMed, 
based on the grant numbers found in the **Portal - Grants Merged** table ([syn21918972]).
To change the table of grants to compare against, use `-g` or `--grantview_id`:

```
python pubmed_crawler.py -t syn21868591 -g syn123
```

Any PMIDs found in PubMed that are not found in the Publications table will
be added to the output file, `publications_manifest_<yyyy-mm-dd>.xlsx`, in the
`output` folder, where `<yyyy-mm-dd>` is the current date.

If there are accompanying datasets, data files, and/or tools, be sure to generate
their templates as well (templates will be found in `output`):

```
python generate_templates.py
```

## :pencil2: Next Steps
Fill out the manifest(s) as needed, using the pre-defined Controlled Vocabulary
listed in **standard_terms** for applicable columns.  Once complete, validate
and upload the manifest(s) with the [MC2 Data Curator App].
